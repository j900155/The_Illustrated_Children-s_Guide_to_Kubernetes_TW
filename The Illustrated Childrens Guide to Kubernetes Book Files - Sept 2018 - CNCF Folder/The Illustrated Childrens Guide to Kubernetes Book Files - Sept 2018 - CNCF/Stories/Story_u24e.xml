				<Content>Once upon a time, there was an app named Phippy. She was a simple app written in PHP and had just one page. She lived on a hosting provider and she shared her environment with scary other apps she didn’t know, and didn’t care to associate with. She wished she had her own environment; just her and a webserver she could call home. </Content>
